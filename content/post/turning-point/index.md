We received the news today that they produced a card yesterday and not on February 8th as they previously claimed. Hopefully this time they actually produced it. I woke up for the first time in months feeling satisfied.\
\
This happened just as I had accepted that nothing could be done about the matter. I kept thinking of the concept of learned helplessness in Psychology. Surely, this is what it must feel like. This feeling seeps into your soul chronically and gives you a slow death.\
\
On the house-buying front, we had a breakthrough. We just realized that we can wire money in small batches to avoid dealing with incompetent tellers at the bank. Oh, what a relief. All is done except the final transfer and related documentation (of course). We will probably close in a week.\
\
I also discovered that LinkedIn is not too bad of a social network. I avoided it all throughout college to repress painful memories, anxieties, and insecurities. I chickened out. Now that I have a good-paying job, I want the world to see me! I am no longer afraid of the world judging me or feeling insecure looking at others’ accomplishments. I have come to terms with who I am realizing that I have given my all every step of the way. I have struggled and the stability I am enjoying is the fruit of that struggle.\
\
I’m afraid that the one above might poke me to rattle my newfound stability. But hey, I will deal with it as it comes. That’s life. #cringe
