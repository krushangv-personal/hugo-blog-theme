Iï»¿ am losing all hope. We filed an amended complaint saying that we never received the document. The USCIS responded by saying that they produced the document on February 8. But that cannot be possible. They are lying. I have taken into account all possibilities, and the most likely scenario is that the agent who was supposed to click the button that would send an approved case to document production misclicked the button and re-approved the case.

Because I have been tracking the number of applications approved each day, I also know that our mandamus kicked off the approval of so many other people. And most of them had their document produced. How pitiful this is.

Going forward, I do not see any other path but to refile the petition and wait another 7 or more months. This means that our legal fees for the case - the 4,500$ - is all for nothing. It also means that my parents have to live apart for more than 17 months and that I will have to cancel my visa stamping trip to the US and the Japan trip.

On the home-buying front, a wire didn't go through and we now have to delay the closing date. We will wait for smaller wires to go through and turn in the final documentation.

It is very hard to encounter any wins nowadays. Bad news and disappointments are piling up. I wake up with disappointing news and go to bed hoping to wake up with better news. Clouds and gloomy weather all around.\*\*

The tennis evaluation session I took last Saturday rated me at a 3.5, which is higher than the 3.0 I was expecting. But this win is hardly enough to counter one day of disappointments.
