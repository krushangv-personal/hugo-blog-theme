I﻿ am stuck in my room on the second day of my four day work trip to Salt Lake City because of a runny nose. It's the allergies! That is what happens when you get too comfortable working from home in a controlled environment. You can't handle new environments anymore. Oh well, at least I got to watch the Medvedev match from my room. 

There are several things on my mind today. One is the feeling that I am wasting my time waiting for stuff. In the recent weeks, it feels like I am spending way too much time waiting for news on the progress of several affairs my family is dealing with. We filed the Advance Parole application so my mother can travel back to India. She has been in the US for more than 8 months now, and I feel guilty because she is away from my father. We filed a Writ of Mandamus (funded by my brother). I impatiently waited for over 6 weeks for the Mandamus to be filed and summons to be served. The summons were served and the case was approved immediately! But some dimwit at the USCIS did not send the AP documents for production as they should have. Now it has been 2 weeks since the approval and 2 weeks of daily disappointment because I wake up without the document in my mail. The attorney said that he will find the amended complaint but God knows how many more weeks is that going to take!

A﻿nother thing that is bothering me is the work involved in buying a house. My brother and I have been very busy dealing with the agents so that the mortgage can go through. The source of fund is closely monitored by the govt and we do not want to break any rules. Agents and people reply at their leisure and do not prioritize your business. What a cruel, lazy world. In fact, the person supposed to wire us the down payment just delayed the wire by a day. Ahhhh nothing gets done anymore.

T﻿here are other issues we are dealing with as well but no point writing all of that down. I just hope good times are ahead for my family soon. Hopelessness and dark times for now.
